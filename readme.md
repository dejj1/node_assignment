## Define Monolithic Architecture
Monolithic architecture is a unified development model for software applications. If the application uses a monolithic architecture, it is built and deployed as a single application, regardless of how a customer uses it.

## Explain Microservices in your own understanding
Microservices is a form of service-oriented architecture style wherein applications are built as a collection of different smaller services instead of one software or application. They are a specific method of designing software systems to structure a single application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Basically it is an achitecture where the application is broken down into smaller independently deployable units, each being run from its own server and contributing to the overall whole application.

## Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?
The microservices architecture appeals more to me because it is easy to debug. Since every microservice unit is a separate entity, developers and engineers can easily spot flaws in the application and fix them promptly. Also it is easy to  scale; with every microservice functioning on its own, I can choose the components to scale or leave as it is. This attribute gives my application more flexibility and makes it scalable.

## Is NodeJS multithreaded?
Nodejs is a singlethreaded language. JavaScript is known to be singlethreaded and NodeJS runs JavaScript with the help of event loops. The event loop runs one process at a time. Meaning it can only execute one function at a time. Hence, NodeJS is built on the concept of single-threaded programming. However, NodeJS can be multithreaded with the use of clusters.

## What does REPL stand for?
REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop.

## Create a javascript file and inside the file add code that will log in to the console, your name, your preferred programming language, and where you see yourself in the next 1 year.
